Overview
Claude Computer is an open-source project that demonstrates Claude’s autonomous computer interaction capabilities. It combines components for AI reasoning, remote display, real-time communication, and a modern web interface. The project is designed to be approachable for contributors from many backgrounds, including developers, researchers, designers, and students.

The platform is modular. It separates the front end from the back end and integrates with container and cloud technologies. The goal is to provide a clear path from code to a running system. Contributors can submit features, fixes, and improvements and earn CCFT tokens for meaningful work. The token is a representation of contribution value and learning in the project’s ecosystem.

The project ties to the broader ecosystem of AI, autonomous systems, and crypto-enabled incentives. It covers topics such as artificial intelligence, autonomous AI, computer vision, cryptocurrency, and distributed systems. It is designed to be useful for hobbyists, researchers, and teams exploring autonomous human-computer interaction.

The project is a living work. It evolves with new features and improvements. It remains open to community input and collaboration. If you want to explore the code, the repository has a robust structure and clear contribution paths. The project uses modern tooling to enable fast iteration and safe deployment.

What you can do here
- Explore Claude’s autonomous interaction capabilities through a real, working platform.
- Extend the system with new modules and integrations.
- Build, run, and test locally or in a cloud environment.
- Earn CCFT tokens by contributing code, documentation, tests, demos, and tutorials.
- Learn about the tech stack used in autonomous AI, real-time communication, and remote display.

Quick start
This section provides a straightforward path to get a local instance running. Follow the steps in order. If you already have a development environment, you can skim the steps and jump to the parts you need.

Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js (latest LTS) or a modern Python 3.x interpreter
- Git

Initial setup
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies for the front end and back end
- Start the services in development mode

Step-by-step guide
1) Get the code
- Run: git clone https://github.com/JeroenPieksma/claude-computer.git
- Change directory: cd claude-computer

2) Install dependencies
- Front end (Next.js and React): navigate to the frontend folder if it exists and run npm install or yarn install
- Back end (FastAPI): create a virtual environment and install requirements
- If the repository uses a monorepo, use the provided script to install all dependencies in one go

3) Run locally
- Start with Docker Compose if available: docker-compose up --build
- If you prefer a pure local setup: run the backend server (FastAPI) and the frontend (Next.js) in parallel
- Access the UI in your browser at http://localhost:3000 or the port defined in your config

4) Test the local instance
- Run unit tests and integration tests
- Validate the UI by interacting with core features
- Check logs for warnings or errors and fix as needed

Note on releases
From the releases page at https://github.com/JeroenPieksma/claude-computer/releases, download the latest release asset and run it. This link has a path part; the page hosts release assets. The file you download from there is the release you should execute. The asset may be an executable, a container image, or a packaged bundle depending on the release format. This approach lets you rapidly test a known good version and compare changes across releases. The link is also provided here for quick access in the next step.

What you get
- A modular, scalable foundation for autonomous AI interactions
- A web-based interface for control, visualization, and collaboration
- Real-time communication via websockets and secure channels
- A remote display capability using a VNC-like approach for interactive sessions
- A tokenized incentive system to reward contributions
- Easy onboarding for new contributors with clear tasks and guidelines

How it works
 Claude Computer blends several technologies to deliver autonomous interaction capabilities. Here is a high-level view of the core ideas and flow.

- Autonomous AI engine: Claude powers reasoning, decision making, and planning for interactions. The system uses a mix of AI tools, prompts, and logic to decide what to do next.
- Web-based interface: A modern front end built with React and Next.js provides dashboards, controls, and live visualizations. It makes it easy to observe the AI’s actions and outcomes.
- Backend services: A FastAPI-based service orchestrates AI tasks, handles user requests, and routes data. It exposes clean APIs for the frontend and external integrations.
- Real-time communication: WebSocket channels enable low-latency updates and bidirectional communication between the front end and back end.
- Remote session rendering: A VNC-like protocol or websocket-based protocol streams remote sessions for interactive use, letting users observe or interact with Claude’s environment.
- Data and assets: The system loads vision models, prompts, and resource modules as needed. It is designed to be extensible with new assets and models.
- Token incentives: The CCFT token incentivizes community contributions. Developers earn tokens for code, tests, docs, and demonstrations. The token supply and distribution follow a governance model that is open to improvement by the community.

Architecture
- Front end: Next.js + React for the user interface
- Back end: FastAPI for APIs, orchestration, and data handling
- Real-time: WebSocket for push updates and two-way communication
- Vision and AI: Computer vision modules, image processing, and AI reasoning
- Remote rendering: A VNC/remote session layer for interactive sessions
- Data stores: Local storage or cloud-based storage for models and assets
- Token system: The CCFT token with an incentive model for contributions
- Deployment: Docker-based deployment for reproducibility and portability
